# Orbit - Your world, perfectly organized

## üåü The Problem

Group chats are chaos. Every topic, from trip planning to memes, gets 
mixed in one endless scroll. Important files vanish. Payments are fragmented. 
There's no organization.

## üöÄ Our Solution

Orbit introduces **Circles** - modular subspaces inside each group where 
everything has its place:

- üå¥ Travel Circle for trips
- üí∞ Expenses Circle for shared costs  
- üì∏ Photos Circle for memories
- üéâ Events Circle for planning
- üí¨ Memes Circle for fun

## üíé Key Features

**Beautiful UX:**
- Circular orbit gallery for intuitive group navigation
- Stack gallery for swiping through photos
- Real-time location sharing on maps
- Responsive design

**Yellow Network Integration:**
- Instant, gasless payments through state channels
- Micro-tipping (as low as $0.01)
- Split payment for group expenses
- Session-based spending control

**Avail Nexus Integration:**
- Cross-chain shared wallets with multi-sig
- Bridge & Execute for seamless deposits
- Unified balance across all chains
- NFT minting for memorable posts

**Blockscout Integration:**
- AI-powered weekly summaries via MCP
- Member leaderboards based on contributions
- Smart content tagging
- Transaction verification and analytics

## üèÜ Why It Matters

From friend groups to DAOs, everyone needs better organization. 
Orbit makes Web3 payments, cross-chain operations, and on-chain 
analytics seamlessly integrated into social coordination.

## üéØ Real Use Cases

- **Friend Groups:** Split dinners, plan trips, share locations

## üé§ Prepare for Q&A

Judges might ask:

### About Yellow Integration
**Q:** How does Yellow's state channel work?  
**A:** Users deposit funds to create a session. All transactions happen 
off-chain instantly with zero gas. When the session ends, final balances 
are settled on-chain in one transaction.

**Q:** Why session-based?  
**A:** Gives users control (set allowance & duration) while enabling 
Web2-speed payments with Web3 security.

### About Avail Integration
**Q:** What is Bridge & Execute?  
**A:** It lets users bridge funds and execute an action on the destination 
chain in one intent. Members can contribute from any chain to the group wallet 
seamlessly.

**Q:** How do shared wallets work?  
**A:** Multi-sig wallets deployed through Avail that require threshold 
signatures (e.g., 2 of 3 owners) for transactions. Perfect for group treasury.

### About Blockscout Integration
**Q:** How does the MCP work?  
**A:** We send prompts to Blockscout's Model Context Protocol. It queries 
on-chain data and uses AI to generate human-readable summaries, rankings, 
and insights.

**Q:** What's a comprehensive prompt?  
**A:** Our wallet analysis prompt asks for activity overview, token holdings, 
DeFi interactions, NFT portfolio, behavior patterns, and recommendations - 
all in one query.

### General Questions
**Q:** Is this production-ready?  
**A:** The integration patterns are production-ready. We show exactly how 
to use each SDK. With real SDK packages, it's a simple swap of implementation.

**Q:** What's next after the hackathon?  
**A:** Week 1: Get real SDK access. Week 2: Integrate actual packages. 
Week 3: Testnet deployment. Week 4: Beta launch.

**Q:** Why these three SDKs?  
**A:** They solve complementary problems - Yellow for instant payments, 
Avail for cross-chain unity, Blockscout for transparency. Together, they 
enable a truly seamless Web3 social experience.
