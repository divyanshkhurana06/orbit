## Post-Demo Q&A Prep

### Expected Questions

**Q: How does Yellow Network handle disputes?**
A: Sessions are cryptographically secured. If there's a dispute, the final state is settled on-chain through smart contracts. All transactions are verifiable.

**Q: What happens if Avail bridge fails?**
A: Intents have built-in safety. If execution fails on destination, funds remain on source chain. Users can retry or cancel. Plus, we show clear status updates.

**Q: How often do Blockscout AI summaries update?**
A: Real-time for transactions, but we cache summaries for 24 hours to respect rate limits. Users can manually refresh if needed.

**Q: Can you show the code?**
A: Absolutely! All three integrations are in `src/integrations/`:
- `yellow.js` - Session management, payments
- `avail.js` - Cross-chain, shared wallets  
- `blockscout.js` - Analytics, MCP prompts

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Core features yes, but we'd add:
- More error handling
- Rate limiting
- Advanced caching
- Mobile optimization
- Real-time WebSocket updates

**Q: How do you handle privacy?**
A: 
- Location sharing is opt-in
- Wallet addresses are shortened
- Group content is private by default
- Users control their own keys

**Q: What's the business model?**
A: Freemium:
- Basic groups: Free
- Premium circles: $2/month (paid via Yellow)
- NFT minting: Small fee
- Enterprise features: Custom pricing

## Technical Details for Deep Dives

### Yellow Integration

**Session Flow:**
1. User deposits USDC to state channel
2. Off-chain transactions happen instantly
3. Final balances settled on-chain at session end
4. Gas paid only once (at settlement)

**Code Reference:**
```javascript
// Create session (yellow.js line 27)
await this.sdk.createSession({
  userAddress,
  allowance: '100',
  duration: 3600,
  token: 'USDC'
});
```

### Avail Integration

**Bridge & Execute Flow:**
1. User initiates cross-chain intent
2. Avail locks funds on source chain
3. Validators verify and execute on destination
4. Action completes (transfer, swap, etc.)
5. Both transactions tracked by intent ID

**Code Reference:**
```javascript
// Bridge and execute (avail.js line 61)
await this.sdk.createIntent({
  type: 'BRIDGE_AND_EXECUTE',
  sourceChain,
  destinationChain,
  amount,
  execution: { action, params }
});
```

### Blockscout Integration

**MCP Query Flow:**
1. App sends prompt to Blockscout MCP
2. MCP queries on-chain data
3. AI (LLM) processes and analyzes
4. Returns human-readable insights
5. App displays to user

**Code Reference:**
```javascript
// AI summary (blockscout.js line 28)
await this.mcp.summarizeActivity({
  addresses: [wallet, ...members],
  timeRange: 'week',
  context: { type: 'social_group' }
});
```

## Video Recording Tips

1. **Record in 1080p or 4K**
2. **Use Chrome for best compatibility**
3. **Have backup recording** (OBS + QuickTime)
4. **Test audio levels** beforehand
5. **Use consistent window sizes** for clean look
6. **Add subtitles** if possible
7. **Include GitHub link** in video description
